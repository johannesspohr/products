# Products Frontend

This is the frontend package for a basic product list. It is built with React, TypeScript and Vite.
shadcn-ui is used for the UI components and `react-query` for data fetching.

The openapi.json file is used to generate the API client and type definitions for the backend.
It has to be manually updated (could be automated of course).

To run locally use
 `pnpm run dev`
